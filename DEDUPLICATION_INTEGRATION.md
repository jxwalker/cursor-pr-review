# Issue Deduplication Integration

## Overview

The issue deduplication system has been successfully integrated into the main review flow. This system prevents duplicate issues from being reported when multiple analysis sources (our AI, CodeRabbit, GitHub AI) detect the same problem.

## How It Works

1. **Enhanced Analysis Flow** (`cursor_pr_review.py`):
   - The `_analyze_with_enhanced_system` method now properly integrates all issue sources
   - External issues (CodeRabbit, GitHub AI) are added to the analyzer BEFORE AI analysis
   - AI is given context of already-found issues to avoid duplicating them
   - All AI findings are converted to Issue objects and deduplicated

2. **Smart Deduplication** (`issue_analyzer.py`):
   - Issues are matched by exact ID or similarity
   - Similar issues are detected based on:
     - Same file and exact line number
     - Same file, nearby lines (within 2 lines), and similar titles
     - Title similarity using keyword matching and Jaccard similarity (70% threshold)
   - When duplicates are found, sources are merged and confidence is increased

3. **Source Attribution**:
   - Each issue tracks all sources that detected it
   - Multi-source issues have higher confidence scores
   - The final report shows which tools found each issue

## Key Features

- **No Duplicate Issues**: Users see each unique issue only once
- **Source Transparency**: Clear attribution showing which tools detected each issue
- **Confidence Scoring**: Issues found by multiple tools have higher confidence
- **Gap Analysis**: Tracks which issues were found by only one tool vs. multiple tools

## Example Output

```
Security Issues:
- SQL injection vulnerability
  Sources: [security_detector, coderabbit]
  Confidence: 90%

Error Handling Issues:
- Bare except clause without exception type
  Sources: [error_handling_detector, coderabbit]
  Confidence: 100%
```

## Testing

The deduplication has been tested with sample data showing:
- Proper merging of similar issues from different sources
- Correct source attribution
- Prevention of duplicate reports
- Accurate gap analysis statistics
