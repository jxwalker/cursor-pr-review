Conduct an extremely thorough code review with zero tolerance for issues. Analyze every line for:

1. **CRITICAL SECURITY ANALYSIS**:
   - Authentication/authorization vulnerabilities
   - Input validation gaps 
   - SQL injection, XSS, CSRF possibilities
   - Cryptographic weaknesses
   - Information disclosure risks

2. **STRICT BUG DETECTION**:
   - Race conditions and concurrency issues
   - Memory leaks and resource management
   - Null pointer/undefined behavior risks
   - Error handling completeness
   - Edge case coverage

3. **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**:
   - Algorithmic complexity analysis
   - Database query efficiency
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Network request optimization
   - Caching opportunities

4. **CODE QUALITY ENFORCEMENT**:
   - SOLID principles adherence
   - Design pattern usage
   - Documentation completeness
   - Test coverage gaps
   - Maintainability concerns

For EVERY issue, provide:
- Exact line references where possible
- Severity: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- Detailed explanation of the problem
- Step-by-step fix instructions
- Security/performance impact assessment

Flag even minor style inconsistencies and suggest improvements. Be thorough and uncompromising.
